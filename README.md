#Money On The Board

Money On The Board was a final project that myself, Adam Dipinto, Kelly James Clancy and Clayton Schroeder worked on at Lighthouse Labs in 2016. 

Inspired by [Ottawa Senators twitter funny guy 'Bonks Mullet's project by the same name,](http://www.bonksmullet.com/p/sensmotb.html) we took on the challenge of automating hockey-based proposition bets where the result was a charitable donation. 

Unfortunately the project is not hosted anywhere, as it was originally built for demo purposes only and does not use any life NHL data (turns out the NHL APIs are very expensive).
